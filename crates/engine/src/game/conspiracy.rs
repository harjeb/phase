//! CR 905: Conspiracy Draft — conspiracy cards in the command zone, including
//! hidden agenda (CR 905.4a + CR 702.106).
//!
//! Conspiracy cards (the `CoreType::Conspiracy` card type) are nontraditional
//! cards that exist only in the command zone. At the start of the game, before
//! decks are shuffled, each player may put any number of conspiracy cards from
//! their sideboard into the command zone (CR 905.4); their owner is their
//! controller (CR 905.5). Conspiracies are not permanents and can't be cast —
//! they apply their abilities from the command zone for the rest of the game.
//!
//! A face-up conspiracy's continuous static abilities function from the command
//! zone the same way a plane's or scheme's do: the database build path
//! (`synthesize_conspiracy`) stamps `Zone::Command` onto the static/trigger
//! definitions (CR 113.6b), and the layer/trigger gathers admit a face-up
//! conspiracy as a command-zone ability source via
//! [`functions_from_command_zone`] — the same seam that admits command-zone
//! emblems (CR 114.3). The per-static zone-of-function gate in
//! `functioning_abilities` (which already passes any command-zone static whose
//! `active_zones` lists `Zone::Command`) then decides whether each individual
//! ability applies.
//!
//! Hidden agenda (CR 905.4a + CR 702.106): a conspiracy with hidden agenda is
//! put into the command zone face down; any time its controller has priority
//! they may turn it face up ([`turn_hidden_agenda_face_up`]). While face down it
//! is not yet functioning, so its abilities don't apply until it is revealed.
//!
//! This is the runtime sibling of `game::archenemy` (schemes) and
//! `game::planechase` (planes/phenomena) — the other command-zone card types.
//! Draft-time abilities (CR 905.2, "as you draft") are out of scope: there is no
//! draft engine.
